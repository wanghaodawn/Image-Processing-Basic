15462 - Computer Graphics Assignment 5 - Image Processing Basis

This assignment includes basic image processing algorithms.
The assignment needs opencv library to read images, I wrote algorithms
by my own without using any libraries.

Also compared the performance among algorithms with similar functions in the same image.


Procedures to run the project:
1) mkdir build && cd build
2) cmake ..
3) make
4) ./asst5_imageprocessing ../images/image1.jpg

After successfully run the image, just press any key to go to next scene.


PS: It seems that it has some problem to read .png files, but it works on JPG, jpg, bmp etc.
